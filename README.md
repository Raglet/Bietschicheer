# Bietschicheer Interactive Map

This is a web application built using the Google Maps API, which displays the terrain and location of various bars, stages, and food stands at the Bietschicheer event.

## Website

The website for this project can be found at [https://raglet.github.io/Bietschicheer/](https://raglet.github.io/Bietschicheer/). You can interact with the map by zooming in/out, dragging the map to navigate, and clicking on the markers to see more information about each location.

## Features

The application utilizes the following features:

- Markers: Markers are placed on the map to represent the various locations at the Bietschicheer event. Each marker is unique to the location it represents and contains information such as the name, type, and description of the location.
- InfoWindows: When a user clicks on a marker, an InfoWindow pops up displaying additional information about the location. The InfoWindow contains information such as the location's name, type, description, and a photo of the location.

## Technology

The application was built using the following technologies:

- Google Maps API: The Google Maps API was used to display the map and add markers and InfoWindows to the map.
- React: The application was built using the React JavaScript library, which helped with the development of the user interface.
- Bootstrap: The Bootstrap CSS framework was used to help with the styling of the application.
